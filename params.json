You can turn it on/off.**\r\n* **Abstracts the http & xml implementation details by strongly typed objects.**\r\n* **Returns the appropriate response in a strongly typed manner.**\r\n* **Supports Windows Phone 7.0 & Windows Phone 7.1. & Windows Phone 8 devices.**\r\n\r\n**Special Features:**\r\n\r\n- **Provides suggestions on next steps as per [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff941100(VS.92).aspx), based on the response.**\r\n- **Supports synchronous & asynchronous methods to send notifications.**\r\n- **Supports authenticated notifications using X509 Certificates. (not many libraries do this.)**\r\n- **Supports Callback Registration Requests. (not many libraries out there do this.)**\r\n- **Supports Localization. Just drop in the appropriate resource files.**\r\n- **In-built error handling so that you always get the response. (with raw exception included)**\r\n\r\n**Versioning Scheme:**\r\n\r\n- **Major Version.Feature Version.Bug Fix (e.g. 1.0.0)**\r\n- **Bug fixes will not be breaking changes.**\r\n- **Feature changes/Major Version changes may not be necessarily breaking changes.** I'll try to avoid it as much as possible.\r\n\r\nthey say that **'if at first you don't succeed, call it version 1.0.'** alright, point taken.\r\n\r\nfeel free to create a [new work item](https://github.com/rajanadar/EasyNotification/issues/new) if you see any issues.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
